									<h2>Arcady Village</h2>
									<p>Arcady Village is a cozy game about managing your own Arcade Hall and getting to know its residents.<br /> It is entirely developed by two people (Michael Hoffmann and me) and is still in development.<br /> It is by far my biggest personal project since its development started more than two years ago.<br /> Being a two-person project, my tasks have naturally been diverse, ranging from creating 3D models and animations to programming.<br />

									Master's Thesis</h1>
									<p>The biggest system I have developed for Arcady Village was my master's thesis. The thesis focuses on developing an advanced NPC behavior system for Arcady Village, integrating hierarchical task networks (HTN) and goal-oriented action planning (GOAP). The NPCs follow dynamic daily schedules and can interrupt their tasks based on external factors, such as encountering a dog and wanting to pet it. The system aims to make NPCs feel more like individuals with personal goals and routines, enhancing player immersion. As shown in the video below, you only have to add goals to a timetable of a character, and the character will handle the execution automatically. This allows the developers to populate a lively city very quickly, without just having NPCs walk around randomly.</p>
