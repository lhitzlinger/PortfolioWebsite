								<p> In the following I want to Showcase a few of my tasks I worked on in my 2.5 years as a working student at MAN ES

								</p>

									<h2>VR Discover Modes</h2>
									<p>
										One of the most frequent tasks was to Showcase some products in VR.<br />
										The worksteps to do so were the following: <br /> 
										<ul class="alt">
										1. Reduce the vertex count since they had to run standalone on Quest 2/Quest 3<br />
										2. Merge Parts to make the material assignment faster <br />
										3. Create and Assign fitting Materials in Unity  <br />
										4. Create new visualization functionalities if needed <br />
									</ul>
										
										I also restructered the whole way those visualization functions work, since this was all one big script beforehand.

								<h2>Spacial anchor System for AR Layoutplanning</h2>
								<p>
									Shortly after the release of the Meta Quest 3, I developed a custom spatial anchor system. The Quest 3 offers the opportunity to generate a mesh based on the room you are currently in.<br />
									Based on this mesh, I created a system where you can select a specific corner as the anchor. <br />
									(An anchor is a virtual reference point in the real world used to postion and lock digital objects in a fixed location) <br />
									This proved to be very useful for planning layouts of production halls, as there is always precise data about the room.<br />
									The models shown in the video are an actual layout as it was planned for a warehouse. <br />
									The real space in which I recorded this is, of course, not the warehouse, but an empty office, so the layout doesn't align here. <br />

								<h2>Rig for crankshaft</h2>
								<p>
									As shown in the video below, I created a mechanical rig for crankshafts in Blender to make it much easier to animate them.

								</p>
								<h2>Low Poly Models</h2>
								<p>
									For some applications that had to run standalone on the Meta Quest 2, with multiple engine models running at the same time, I created low-poly versions of those models to significantly enhance performance.
